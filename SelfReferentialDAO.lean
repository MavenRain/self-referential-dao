  SelfReferentialDAO

  A denotational design (Conal Elliott) for a self-referential DAO, with
  the semantic domain supplied by the UnifiedAggregation (UAT) categorical
  machinery.  This file is a reservoir library: downstream DAO projects
  `require` it and reuse the meaning function, the governance endo-operation
  `Gov`, the self-constitution predicate, and the three self-governance
  corollaries (no self-constitution / unique self-constitution / object-fork),
  all reduced to the UAT regime predicates.

  Central denotation:

    ⟦DAO⟧ = Aggregation act F = LeftKanExtension (orbitProjection act) F.

  A DAO is the universal way to lift anonymous local member choices `F`
  to one global outcome along the voter-orbit quotient `orbitProjection act`.

  Two concrete anonymity witnesses are instantiated from UAT's bridge
  modules: the BINARY `Z₂` faction flip (`spinConfigAction`, sections 8 and
  9) and its q-ARY generalization, the `S_q` Potts colour symmetry
  (`pottsConfigAction`, section 10), which reads the DAO as `q`
  interchangeable candidate choices rather than two interchangeable factions.
  Both reuse the same generic `Gov` / self-constitution / trichotomy core
  (sections 1 through 7) unchanged; the q-ary case is a drop-in re-run of the
  section 8/9 narrative, with the honest scope below carrying over verbatim.

  Design conventions honored throughout:
  - Lean 4 only, no Mathlib dependency (builds on comp-cat-theory,
    kan-tactics, unified-aggregation-theory).
  - Inside every `by` block: kan-tactics only.  Classical case analysis,
    destructuring, and structure-field substitution are done in TERM MODE
    (pattern-matching equations, `fun`, anonymous constructors, `.rec`),
    which the convention permits.
  - No partiality leaks: genuine partiality is `Option`-valued (the
    impossibility regime), handled by combinators / a dependent `if`,
    never panic/throw, never a `match` on `Option`.
  - `set_option autoImplicit false`; structures/newtypes over primitives.
  - No em-dashes anywhere.

  Honest scope (read before citing): the headline correspondence between the
  governance phase transition and the mean-field bifurcation holds at the
  level of OBJECT-DISTINCT AGGREGATIONS (the regime currency), NOT at the
  level of the fixed-point predicate `IsSelfConstituting`.  For the shipped
  constant constitution `magChoiceRule n β = constIndiscrete (zeroPhase β)`,
  `IsSelfConstituting` is single-valued at every `β` (it is always satisfied
  by the zero-phase realization, and ONLY by it), so it does not bifurcate.
  The fork lives in the cardinality of `Aggregation`-object-assignments, and
  that cardinality is exactly the fixed-point set computed by
  `mean_field_bifurcation`.  Both claims are theorems below
  (`canonical_self_constituting`, `nonzero_phase_not_fixpoint`,
  `self_constitution_unique_zero_phase`, `fork_transition`).  Making
  `IsSelfConstituting` itself bifurcate would require a NON-constant
  constitution that genuinely pins its order parameter; that is flagged as
  the prime extension and is not delivered here.

  Status: builds green against the real API (lake build passes, zero
  `sorry`); the load-bearing theorems use only the standard classical
  axioms (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound), and the pure regime
  reductions use propext alone.  Downstream `lakefile.toml` should carry:

/-! ## 1. The meaning function `⟦·⟧`

The MODEL of a DAO is `Aggregation act F`, a `Type` of left Kan extensions.
A REPRESENTATION is a packaging of the data a DAO instance is built from
(the symmetry `G`, its action `act`, and the local constitution `F`).  The
meaning of a representation is the corresponding aggregation type.

Universe note (honest): `Aggregation` natively takes `G : SymmetryGroup.{w}`
freely, with `OrbitGroupoid act : Type u` and `OrbitHom : Type (max u w)`.
The UAT regime predicates and `trichotomy`, however, are stated at `{u}`
with the group in the object universe.  To reuse those predicates verbatim
the DAO RESTRICTS the group universe to `w = u`.  This is a design choice
that loses no DAO-relevant generality (one anonymity group, one config
universe), not a forced theorem; the underlying `Aggregation` construction
is strictly more general. -/

/-- The REPRESENTATION of a DAO: the anonymizing symmetry action together
with the local-to-local constitution.  These are exactly the inputs the
central `Aggregation` construction consumes; nothing about storage,
ballots-as-bytes, gas, or block height appears here. -/

    (Obj : Type u) [Category.{u, u} Obj]
    (G : SymmetryGroup.{u}) (D : Type v) [Category.{v, v} D] where
  /-- The anonymity action: how the relabeling group `G` permutes members.
  Anonymity is denoted by this action, and becomes a THEOREM about `⟦·⟧`

the type of left Kan extensions of the constitution along the voter-orbit

/-! ## 2. The governance endo-operation `Gov`

`Gov` restricts a chosen global aggregate `L` back to a local rule: read a
config, project to its voter-orbit, report the global verdict there.  The
naive `orbitProjection act ⋙ (Aggregation act F).functor` is ILL-TYPED
(`Aggregation act F` is a `Type`, it has no `.functor` projection).  The
type-correct form carries the chosen realization `L` explicitly; that
dependence on `L` is precisely the none / one / many structure the
trichotomy classifies, not a wart. -/

/-- The governance endo-operation on constitutions, relative to a chosen
aggregation `L`.  `orbitProjection act : Obj ⥤ OrbitGroupoid act` and
`L.functor : OrbitGroupoid act ⥤ D`, so the composite (apply
`orbitProjection` first, then `L.functor`) is a `ChoiceRule Obj D`. -/

the governance operation on the model. -/

functor `Gov L`, so `⟦propose p ; q⟧ = ⟦propose q⟧ ∘ ⟦propose p⟧` is FORCED
by `Gov L` being a functor.  Vacuous over a discrete `Obj` (only identity
proposals); content-bearing over any non-discrete configuration category. -/

/-! ## 3. The canonical comparison and the unit at a fixpoint

The comparison natural transformation `η : F ⟹ Gov L` is NOT new data: it
is exactly the Lan unit `L.unit : F ⟹ (orbitProjection act ⋙ L.functor)`.
This is the coalgebra structure (Lambek framing): a self-constituting `F`
is one where this structure map becomes an endomorphism. -/

/-- The canonical comparison `η : F ⟹ Gov L` is the Lan unit, definitionally.
Used by `fixpointEndo` (the functor-level strengthening) and named so that
downstream consumers can speak of the coalgebra structure map directly. -/

  L.unit

/-- At a *functor-level* fixpoint `Gov L = F`, transport the canonical unit
to an endo-natural-transformation `F ⟹ F`.  Functor equality is stronger
than the object-equality the regimes read; over the indiscrete phase target
it is automatic (every `map`-HEq is free), and that is the only place the
object-fork lives, so this form is available exactly where it is wanted.
Provided for downstream consumers that establish a functor-level fixpoint;
not instantiated by a concrete witness here (the shipped target is
indiscrete, where functor equality would be free but is not load-bearing). -/

  -- Rewrite only the codomain `Gov L` to `F` in `govUnit L : F ⟹ Gov L`.
  -- `▸` cannot infer this higher-order motive, so transport explicitly.
  @Eq.mp (F ⟹ Gov L) (F ⟹ F) (congrArg (NatTrans F) h) (govUnit L)

/-! ## 4. The fixed point and `IsSelfConstituting`

Three notions of fixpoint were possible: functor equality (too strong, and
not what the predicates see), object equality (the regime currency), and
natural isomorphism (vacuous over the indiscrete target, where every
parallel pair is iso).  We use OBJECT equality.  `IsFixedPointObj L` then
says the local rule `Gov L` agrees object-wise with the constitution `F`.

CAUTION (load-bearing honesty, see the file header): for the shipped
constant constitution `IsFixedPointObj` is satisfied by exactly one
realization (the zero phase) at every `β`, so `IsSelfConstituting` does NOT
bifurcate.  The object-fork (`constitutional_fork`) is a statement about
`Aggregation`-object-assignments, which is strictly weaker than (and
disjoint in content from) self-constitution for this constitution. -/

/-- `L` self-constitutes at the object level: the local rule it induces by
self-aggregation agrees, object-wise, with the constitution `F` it came
from.  Since `(Gov L).obj X = L.functor.obj ⟨X⟩`, this is the object-level
content witnessed by the Lan unit precisely when `L.functor.obj ⟨X⟩` lands
back on `F.obj X`. -/

/-- A self-referential DAO: a constitution `F` admitting an aggregation `L`
that self-constitutes.  Existence-form, so it is a total `Prop` with no
partiality in its type.  It is FALSE in Arrow-Impossibility (no aggregation
at all).  It is TRUE whenever some realization fixes `F` object-wise; for
the shipped constant constitution that realization is the zero phase, and it
is the UNIQUE one (`self_constitution_unique_zero_phase`), at every regime.
The *cardinality* of object-distinct aggregations, which is what forks, is a
SEPARATE quantity read off the regime, not from this predicate. -/

/-- The relational graph of governance: `d` is *a* legitimate verdict at
`X`.  This is the multivalued side (it stays a `Prop`, never collapsed to a

to its graph. -/

/-- Every chosen aggregation populates the governance graph at its own

not inert. -/

  ⟨L, rfl⟩

/-! ## 5. The partial value interface `govObj`

Genuine partiality (the Arrow-Impossibility regime, where no aggregation
exists) is encoded with `Option`, never an exception.  `Option` not
`Except`: impossibility carries no informative error payload, it is a single
uninformative absence, so `Option` is the right shape.  `Classical.choice`
selects an aggregation when one exists; in the Arrow-Debreu regime the
choice is irrelevant (object-unique).  We branch with a dependent `if`
(`dite`) reduced by `dif_pos` / `dif_neg`, never a `match` on an `Option`. -/

/-- The governance partial value at a config `X`: `some d` when some
aggregation exists and assigns verdict `d` to `X`'s orbit, and `none`
exactly in the Arrow-Impossibility regime.  No `match` on `Option`, no
exception: the `none` branch is the clean denotation of impossibility. -/

  if h : Nonempty (Aggregation act F)
    then some ((Gov (Classical.choice h)).obj X)

/-- In the Arrow-Impossibility regime `govObj` is `none`.  Uses `dif_neg`

/-- Conversely, if `govObj` is `none` then we are in the Arrow-Impossibility

`some _`, contradicting `none` by `Option.some_ne_none`. -/

/-! ## 6. Homomorphism laws and re-exported regime facts (Conal discipline)

Honest framing.  Conal's "the meaning of every operation is FORCED by
`⟦op a b⟧ = op' ⟦a⟧ ⟦b⟧`" is carried out for the ONE genuine operation this
design defines on representations: amendment.  `govPhi_canonical_eq_gov`
(section 2) is exactly `⟦amend⟧ = Gov`, an equation relating an operation on
representations to an operation on the model, by `rfl`.

We do NOT claim the broader "instances are morphisms" slogan: no algebraic
type class (Monoid, Functor, ...) on `DAORep` is given a structure-preserving
`⟦·⟧`.  The two natural candidates are out of scope (treasury needs a
monoidal `D`; naturality of `F ↦ Aggregation act F` needs a 2-categorical
statement absent from the verified surface), so the slogan is RETRACTED, not
quietly dropped.  The remaining laws below are: (a) `gov_map_comp`
(functoriality of the induced constitution, the content-bearing half of
`⟦·⟧`), and (b) re-exports of UAT facts under DAO names, each labelled as a
re-export of a model property rather than a homomorphism. -/

/-- RE-EXPORT (model property, not a homomorphism law).  Anonymity:
`⟦tally⟧` respects member relabeling, as a THEOREM not an axiom.  Existence
of the aggregation (a Lan along the orbit projection) forces the rule to
take equal values on `x` and `act g x`.  Delegates to the UAT theorem
`lan_implies_orbit_constant` (stated over a discrete outcome target). -/

/-! ## 7. The three fates of self-governance, reduced to UAT regimes

Each corollary unfolds, through `gov_obj` (`(Gov L).obj X = L.functor.obj
⟨X⟩`), to the corresponding regime predicate.  No regime fact is re-proved.

These three are honestly named for what they are: `no_self_constitution` is
a genuine statement about `IsSelfConstituting`; `unique_self_constitution`
and `constitutional_fork` are statements about object-uniqueness /
object-distinctness of `Gov`-induced verdicts (the regime currency), NOT
about the fixed-point set.  The relationship between the object-fork and the
fixed-point set is made precise in section 8 (it does NOT fork). -/

/-- (i) NO SELF-CONSTITUTION.  In the Arrow-Impossibility regime there is no
aggregation at all, so no self-constituting `L`.  Governance is impossible.
A genuine statement about `IsSelfConstituting`. -/

/-- (ii) OBJECT-UNIQUE GOVERNANCE (consensus).  In the Arrow-Debreu regime an
aggregation exists and is object-unique, so any two governance-induced local
rules agree object-wise: a single legitimate verdict per config.  Reduces to
the regime's own `∀ L', ∀ Y, L.functor.obj Y = L'.functor.obj Y` by
specializing `Y` to `⟨X⟩`.  (Statement about object-uniqueness of `Gov`, not
about the fixed-point set.) -/

  match h with
  | ⟨L, huniq⟩ => ⟨L, fun L' X => huniq L' { val := X }⟩

/-- (iii) CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECT-FORK.  In the Schelling-Ising regime two
aggregations disagree on an object, i.e. two distinct legitimate verdicts at
some config.  Reduces to the regime predicate by taking the witnessing orbit
object `Y` and reading it as `⟨Y.val⟩`.

This is non-uniqueness of the AGGREGATION (its object-assignment), which is
exactly `IsSchellingIsingRegime` with `Y` renamed.  It is NOT a claim that
`L₁, L₂` are two self-constituting fixpoints; for the shipped constitution
they are not (see `nonzero_phase_not_fixpoint`). -/

/-! ## 8. Self-constitution of the canonical witness, and the honest
correspondence with `mean_field_bifurcation`

This section states EXACTLY what self-constitution does and does not do for
the shipped constant constitution `magChoiceRule n β = constIndiscrete
(zeroPhase β)`.  Two facts, both proved:

  (A) `IsSelfConstituting (magChoiceRule n β)` holds at EVERY `β`, witnessed
      by the zero-phase realization, and that realization is the ONLY one
      (object-wise) that self-constitutes.  So `IsSelfConstituting` is
      single-valued and does NOT bifurcate.

  (B) The object-distinct aggregations of the SAME constitution DO bifurcate
      1 → 2 at `β_c = 1` (`fork_transition`), and their count equals the
      mean-field fixed-point set.  This is the genuine correspondence, and it
      is a statement about `Aggregation`-object-cardinality, NOT about the
      fixed-point predicate.

The constant constitution sends every config to the reference phase
`zeroPhase β = ⟨0⟩`.  A realization `L` self-constitutes iff its chosen
phase object is `zeroPhase β`.  The fork branches sit at `±m_*`, which for
`m_* ≠ 0` are object-distinct from `F.obj X = ⟨0⟩`, hence NOT fixpoints.
Making `IsSelfConstituting` itself fork would require a non-constant
constitution that pins its order parameter (so `F.obj X = ⟨m_*(X)⟩`); that
is the prime extension and is not delivered here. -/

/-- The zero-phase realization of the canonical constitution: the
`indiscreteLan` at `zeroPhase β`.  Its functor is `constIndiscrete
(zeroPhase β) = magChoiceRule n β`, so it lands back on the constitution. -/
noncomputable def zeroPhaseAggregation (n : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    Aggregation (spinConfigAction n) (magChoiceRule n β) :=
  indiscreteLan (orbitProjection (spinConfigAction n)) (magChoiceRule n β)
    (zeroPhase β)

/-- The zero-phase realization self-constitutes at every `β`: `(Gov L).obj X
= L.functor.obj ⟨X⟩ = zeroPhase β = (magChoiceRule n β).obj X`, all four by
`rfl` (the `indiscreteLan` functor and `magChoiceRule` are both
`constIndiscrete (zeroPhase β)`).  The `β`-hypothesis is genuinely unused:
this holds in every regime. -/
theorem zeroPhaseAggregation_isFixedPoint (n : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    IsFixedPointObj (act := spinConfigAction n) (zeroPhaseAggregation n β) :=
  fun _ => rfl

/-- (A, existence half) The canonical self-referential DAO IS
self-constituting, at EVERY `β` (consensus AND above the critical pressure),
via the zero-phase realization.  This is single-valued: `IsSelfConstituting`
does not bifurcate.  Contrast `fork_transition`, where the OBJECT-distinct
aggregations bifurcate. -/
theorem canonical_self_constituting (n : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    IsSelfConstituting (act := spinConfigAction n) (magChoiceRule n β) :=
  ⟨zeroPhaseAggregation n β, zeroPhaseAggregation_isFixedPoint n β⟩

/-- (A, uniqueness half) A nonzero phase is NOT a fixpoint of governance for
the constant constitution.  If `m ≠ 0` is a mean-field fixed point, the
`indiscreteLan` at `⟨m⟩` assigns verdict `⟨m⟩ ≠ ⟨0⟩ = F.obj X` at the
all-up config, so `IsFixedPointObj` fails.  This is the precise refutation
of "±m_* are two self-constitutions": they are object-distinct aggregations,
not fixpoints.

Proof: instantiate `IsFixedPointObj` at `X = upConfig n`.  `(Gov L).obj X`
is `⟨⟨m, hm⟩⟩` and `F.obj X` is `zeroPhase β = ⟨⟨0, _⟩⟩`, both by `rfl`; the
two `Indiscrete` objects are unequal because `m ≠ 0` lifts through
`Subtype.val` and `Indiscrete.val`. -/
theorem nonzero_phase_not_fixpoint (n : Nat) {β m : Rat}
    (hm : m ≠ 0) (hfix : IsMeanFieldFixedPoint β m) :
    ¬ IsFixedPointObj (act := spinConfigAction n)
        (indiscreteLan (orbitProjection (spinConfigAction n))
          (magChoiceRule n β) (Indiscrete.mk ⟨m, hfix⟩)) :=
  fun hself =>
    hm (congrArg Subtype.val
      (congrArg Indiscrete.val (hself (Discrete.mk (upConfig n)))))

/-- (A, summary) For the shipped constant constitution, the ONLY object-wise
verdict that self-constitutes is the zero phase: any self-constituting
realization assigns `zeroPhase β` at the all-up config.  Hence
`IsSelfConstituting` carries a single witness class at every `β` and cannot
bifurcate; the fork lives entirely in `Aggregation`-object-cardinality. -/
theorem self_constitution_unique_zero_phase (n : Nat) (β : Rat)
    (L : Aggregation (spinConfigAction n) (magChoiceRule n β))
    (hself : IsFixedPointObj (act := spinConfigAction n) L) :
    L.functor.obj { val := Discrete.mk (upConfig n) } = zeroPhase β :=
  hself (Discrete.mk (upConfig n))

/-! ## 9. The fork transition, tied to `mean_field_bifurcation`

Instantiated at the canonical target `D = MagPhase β`, `Obj = SpinConfigCat
n`, `act = spinConfigAction n`, `F = magChoiceRule n β`, the OBJECT-FORK is
the two ends of the mean-field pitchfork at `β_c = 1`.  Both legs are the
SAME `Aggregation` construction; the existence proofs are reused verbatim
from UAT.  This is the (B) correspondence of section 8: it is about
object-distinct aggregations, NOT about the fixed-point set (which does not
fork, by section 8 (A)). -/

/-- THE GOVERNANCE PHASE TRANSITION IS AN OBJECT-FORK TRANSITION.  Below the
critical coordination pressure (`β ≤ 1`) the DAO's governance verdict is
object-unique (consensus); above it (`β > 1`) two distinct legitimate
verdicts `±m_*` appear at some config (a fork in the realized aggregate).
`β_c = 1` is inherited verbatim from `mean_field_bifurcation` via the UAT
regime witnesses `paramagnetic_arrow_debreu_regime` and
`schelling_ising_regime`.

HONEST READING: the second leg asserts `(Gov L₁).obj X ≠ (Gov L₂).obj X`,
i.e. two object-distinct AGGREGATIONS, NOT two self-constituting fixpoints
(see `nonzero_phase_not_fixpoint`).  `IsSelfConstituting` itself is
single-valued at all `β` (`canonical_self_constituting`); the bifurcation is
in the cardinality of `Aggregation` object-assignments, which equals the
mean-field fixed-point set. -/

    (β ≤ 1 →
       ∃ L : Aggregation (spinConfigAction n) (magChoiceRule n β),
         ∀ L' : Aggregation (spinConfigAction n) (magChoiceRule n β),

  ⟨fun hβ => unique_self_constitution (paramagnetic_arrow_debreu_regime n hβ),
   fun hβ => constitutional_fork (schelling_ising_regime n hβ)⟩

/-- Existence corollary: below `β_c` the canonical self-referential DAO has
an aggregation (the `indiscreteLan` at the unique paramagnetic phase).
Strictly weaker than `canonical_self_constituting`, kept for the regime
audit trail. -/

/-! ## 10. The q-state Potts generalization (multi-candidate governance)

Sections 8 and 9 instantiate the self-governance machinery at the BINARY
Ising witness `spinConfigAction` (the `Z₂` faction flip).  UAT's
`Bridge.Potts` generalizes that witness to a `q`-ary Potts spin under the
full permutation symmetry `S_q` on the colours, with the categorical core
(`Aggregation`, `orbitProjection`, the three regime predicates, and
`trichotomy`) reused verbatim.  Reading the colours as `q` candidate
choices, this is exactly the DAO with `q` interchangeable options rather
than two interchangeable factions.

Because sections 1 through 7 are polymorphic in the action, NOTHING in the
generic core changes.  This section just re-runs the section 8/9 narrative
on `pottsConfigAction n q` and `pottsChoiceRule n q β`, delegating to UAT's
Potts regime witnesses (`potts_disordered_arrow_debreu_regime`,
`potts_ordered_schelling_ising_regime`, `potts_arrow_impossibility_regime`).
The honest scope of sections 8 and 9 carries over UNCHANGED: the shipped
`pottsChoiceRule` is the constant rule onto the disordered phase, so
`IsSelfConstituting` stays single-valued (the uniform phase) at every `β`,
while the OBJECT-distinct aggregations fork.  The new q-ary content is that
above `β_c = 1` the ordered phases form an `S_q`-orbit of size `q` (one
dominant colour each), so the realized-aggregate fork is q-fold rather than
the binary `±m_*` pair; the regime currency (object-distinctness) only sees
"at least two", which is all `constitutional_fork` consumes. -/

/-- The disordered-phase realization of the q-ary constitution: the
`indiscreteLan` at `pottsUniformPhase q β`.  The Potts analogue of
`zeroPhaseAggregation`; its functor is `constIndiscrete (pottsUniformPhase
q β) = pottsChoiceRule n q β`, so it lands back on the constitution. -/
noncomputable def pottsUniformAggregation (n q : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    Aggregation (pottsConfigAction n q) (pottsChoiceRule n q β) :=
  indiscreteLan (orbitProjection (pottsConfigAction n q)) (pottsChoiceRule n q β)
    (pottsUniformPhase q β)

/-- The disordered realization self-constitutes at every `β`: `(Gov L).obj X
= L.functor.obj ⟨X⟩ = pottsUniformPhase q β = (pottsChoiceRule n q β).obj X`,
all by `rfl` (both the `indiscreteLan` functor and `pottsChoiceRule` are
`constIndiscrete (pottsUniformPhase q β)`).  The `β`-hypothesis is unused:
this holds in every regime, the q-ary mirror of
`zeroPhaseAggregation_isFixedPoint`. -/
theorem pottsUniformAggregation_isFixedPoint (n q : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    IsFixedPointObj (act := pottsConfigAction n q) (pottsUniformAggregation n q β) :=
  fun _ => rfl

/-- (q-ary A, existence half) The canonical multi-candidate DAO IS
self-constituting at EVERY `β`, via the disordered realization.  Like
`canonical_self_constituting`, this is single-valued: `IsSelfConstituting`
does not bifurcate.  The fork lives in object-distinct aggregations
(`potts_fork_transition`), not here. -/
theorem potts_canonical_self_constituting (n q : Nat) (β : Rat) :
    IsSelfConstituting (act := pottsConfigAction n q) (pottsChoiceRule n q β) :=
  ⟨pottsUniformAggregation n q β, pottsUniformAggregation_isFixedPoint n q β⟩

/-- (q-ary A, uniqueness half) An ORDERED phase (a single colour `a`
carrying a nonzero field `m`) is NOT a fixpoint of governance for the
constant q-ary constitution.  The `indiscreteLan` at `pottsOrdered q a m`
assigns the verdict `pottsOrdered q a m`, which differs from the
constitution's `pottsUniform q` at colour `a` (`m ≠ 0`), so `IsFixedPointObj`
fails.  The Potts analogue of `nonzero_phase_not_fixpoint`, and the precise
refutation of "the `S_q`-orbit phases are self-constitutions": they are
object-distinct aggregations, not fixpoints.

Proof: instantiate `IsFixedPointObj` at the constant config `fun _ => a`.
`(Gov L).obj X` is `pottsOrdered q a m` and `F.obj X` is `pottsUniform q`,
both by `rfl`; reading both at colour `a` gives `m = 0` (via
`pottsOrdered_apply_self` and `pottsUniform q a = 0`), contradicting `hm`. -/

/-- (q-ary A, summary) For the shipped constant q-ary constitution the only
object-wise verdict that self-constitutes is the disordered phase: any
self-constituting realization assigns `pottsUniformPhase q β` at every
config.  Hence `IsSelfConstituting` carries a single witness class at every
`β`; the fork lives entirely in `Aggregation`-object-cardinality.  The Potts
analogue of `self_constitution_unique_zero_phase` (stated for an arbitrary
config, since the constant rule distinguishes none). -/

/-- (q-ary i) NO SELF-CONSTITUTION for a non-anonymous q-ary rule.  The
